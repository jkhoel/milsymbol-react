# milsymbol-react
A react component that renders a milsymbol-generated SVG.

This component is based heavily on the function .asSVG() native to the [milsym library](https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol) by MÃ¥ns Beckman. This library is required for this component to fuction, as well as a normal working react project.

#### Props
The component takes a SIDC string and options - same as regular milsym symbols. [See their documentation for more information and example usage](https://www.spatialillusions.com/milsymbol/docs/index.html)
